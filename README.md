# Logistic_regression_explained

Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. In logistic regression, the dependent variable can be a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 (yes, toxic, etc.) or 0 (no, non-toxic, etc.). In other words, the logistic regression model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X.

This repository reprsents a simple example of logistic regression and supervised binary classification problem.
